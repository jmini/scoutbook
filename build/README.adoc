This folder contains the documents that are build.

* `scout_helloworld`: produces an article as single page to explain how to create an demo application (the html version is published on the scout webpage)
* `scout_install`: produces an article as single page to explain how to downlaod the scout IDE (the html version is published on the scout webpage)
* `book_scout_intro`: produces a book called "Eclipse Scout: an Introduction"
* `book_scout_frontend`: produces a book called "Eclipse Scout: Frontend Development"
* `eclipse_help`: produces the necessary pages for the "Eclipse Scout User Guide" (in the `org.eclipse.scout.sdk.help` plugin). The list of pages needs to be kept up to date and ordered in link:eclipse_help/help-pages.txt[help-pages.txt].

== Usage

You can generate all documents using maven at the root of the `build` folder:

 mvn

You can generate one document by switching to one of subfolder and unsing maven:

 cd scout_helloworld/
 mvn
 
The results are generated in the `target` subfolder. For example for `scout_helloworld`:

 scout_helloworld/target/generated-docs/scout_helloworld.html
 scout_helloworld/target/generated-docs/scout_helloworld.pdf
