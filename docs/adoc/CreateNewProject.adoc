Start your Eclipse IDE and select an empty directory for your workspace. 
This workspace directory will then hold all the project code for the "`Hello World`" application. 
Once the Eclipse IDE is running it will show the Scout perspective with the {scoutExplorerView} and an empty {scoutPropView}.
To create a new Scout project select the menu:New Scout Project...[] context menu as shown in <<img-sdk_create_new_scout_project>>.

In the [wizard]_New Scout Project_ wizard enter a name for your Scout project. 
As we are creating a "`Hello World`" application, use [java]+org.eclipsescout.helloworld+ for the [field]_Project Name_ field according to <<img-sdk_new_project_wizard>>.
Then, click the btn:[Finish] button to let the Scout SDK create the initial project code for you.

Once the initial project code is built, the Scout SDK displays the application model in the _Scout Explorer_ as shown in <<img-sdk_initial_helloworld_project>>.
This model is visually presented as a tree structure covering both the client and the server part of the application.
The Scout Explorer view on the left hand side displays the top level elements of the complete Scout application.
Under the orange node the Scout client components are listed. 
Components that are needed in both the Scout client and the Scout server are collected under the green node.
And the Scout server components are listed below the blue node in the Scout Explorer view.
