Before you can install Scout make sure that you have a working Java Development Kit (JDK) installation of version 7 or 8.
To download the Eclipse Scout package visit the official Eclipse download page as shown in <<img-scout_download>>.

If the download page shows the wrong platform, manually select the correct platform in the dropdown list.
As shown in <<img-scout_download>>, the Scout package is available as a 32 bit and a 46 bit package. 
Make sure to pick the package that matches your JDK installation. 
You can check your installation on the command line as follows.

----
console-prompt>java -version
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)
----

If the output explicitly mentions the 64 bit installation as shown above, you have a 64 bit installation. 
Otherwise, you have a 32 bit JDK installed.
Now you can select the correct Scout package from the Eclipse download site. 
After the package selection, confirm the suggested download mirror as shown in <<img-scout_download_mirror>>.

As the Scout package is a simple ZIP (or tar.gz) file, you may unpack its content to a folder of your choice.
Inside the eclipse sub-folder, you will then find the Eclipse executable file, such as the `eclipse.exe` file on a Windows plattform. 
Starting the Eclipse executable brings up the workspace launcher as shown in <<img-scout_start>>.

Into the [field]_Workspace_ field you enter an empty target directory for your first Scout project. 
After clicking the btn:[Ok] button, the Eclipse IDE creates any directories that do not yet exist and opens the specified workspace. 
When opening a new workspace for the first time, Eclipse then displays the welcome screen shown in <<img-scout_welcome>>.

To close the welcome page and open the Scout perspective in the Eclipse IDE click on the [icon]_Workbench_ icon. 
As a result the empty Scout perspective is displayed according to <<img-scout_perspective>>.
