//Asciidoctor input file: "Create the hello world backend"

The responsibility of the Scout server in our "`Hello World`" application is to provide an initial text content for the message field in the client's user interface.
We implement this behaviour in the [java]+load+ method of the server's [java]+DesktopService+.
An empty stub for the [java]+load+ method of the [java]+DesktopService+ service has already been created during the initial project creation step. 

To navigate to the implementation of the desktop service in the Scout SDK, we first expand the blue top-level [node]_server_ node in the Scout Explorer.
Below the server node, we then expand the [folder]_Services_ folder which shows the [element]_DesktopService_ element.
Expanding this [element]_DesktopService_ node, the [java]+load+ method becomes visible as shown in <<img-helloworld_load_servicemethod>>.

.The Scout Explorer showing the blue server node expanded with the [folder]_Services_ folder. In this folder the [element]_load_ method of [element]_DesktopService_ is selected and its initial implementation is shown in the editor on the right side.

The [java]+DesktopService+ represents the server service corresponding to the [java]+DesktopForm+ on the client side.
This initial setup represents Scout's default where client forms and server services typically come in pairs.
Whenever the client's user interface displays a form to the user, the client connects to the server and calls the [java]+load+ method of the corresponding server service.
We just need to add our business logic to the [java]+load+ method of the server's [java]+DesktopService+.

According to the signature of the [java]+load+ method, a [java]+formData+ object is passed into this method that is then handed back in the return statement.
To complete the implementation of the [java]+load+ method it is sufficient to assign the text 'hello world!' to the message field part of the form data.
The complete implementation of the [java]+load+ method is provided in <<lst-helloworld.desktopservice.load>>.

With this last element we have completed the Scout "`Hello World`" application.
