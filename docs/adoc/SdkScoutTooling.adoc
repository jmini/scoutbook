Thanks to this tooling, developing Scout applications is made simpler, more productive and also more robust. 
Initially, a solid understanding of the Java language is sufficient to start developing Scout applications and only a rough understanding of the underlying Eclipse/OSGi/JEE technologies is required. 

The Scout SDK consists of navigation support for the application model defined by the Scout runtime and provides many intuitive component wizards. 
This creates an ideal environment for beginners to build complete, high-quality Scout applications. 
Typically Java developers only need a few days of Scout training to start creating their own advanced client server business applications. 

The Scout SDK also helps developers to become more productive.
Many repetitive and error prone tasks run automatically in the background or are taken care of by the component wizards of the Scout SDK. 
This starts with the initial creation of a Scout client server application, continues with the wizards to create complete dialogs and pages and includes the automatic management of the data transfer objects needed for the client server communication.

Finally, the application code created by the Scout SDK wizards helps to ensure that the resulting Scout application has a consistent and robust code base and is well aligned with the application model defined by the Scout runtime framework.
